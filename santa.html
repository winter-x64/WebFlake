        <h2>Santa Claus, also known as Father Christmas, Saint Nicholas, Kris Kringle, or simply Santa, is a legendary figure originating in Western Christian culture.</h2>
        <p>
            The modern figure of Santa is based on folklore traditions surrounding Saint Nicholas, Father Christmas, Belsnickel, and Sinterklaas. He is depicted as a jolly, white-bearded man in a red suit, carrying gifts for children.
        </p>
        <p>
            Saint Nicholas, a 4th-century Greek Christian bishop, was known for his generous gifts to the poor. His bones were later removed to Bari, Italy, where they are now enshrined.
        </p>
        <p>
            During the Middle Ages, children were gifted on the evening before his name day of 6 December. The custom later shifted to Christmas as a gift-giving tradition.
        </p>
        <p>
            Saint Nicholas is claimed as the patron saint of archers, sailors, children, and many other diverse groups. He remains an influential figure in Christmas traditions.
